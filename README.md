# FMCW Radar Point Cloud LSTM for Hand Gesture Recognition

**Classification of 12 Hand Gestures Using LSTM Networks on Radar Point Cloud Data**

This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** to classify **12 distinct hand gestures** captured using **Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar**. Implemented in **PyTorch**, the model processes sequential radar point cloud data to learn temporal features, enabling robust and accurate gesture recognition.

**Dataset:** [Hand gestures recorded with mm-Wave FMCW radar (AWR1642)](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/hand-gestures-recorded-mm-wave-fmcw-radar-awr1642)
